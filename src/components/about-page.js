    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      The Wren and Cuff Custom Shop is a place where you can create your own
      pedal, from the tone and mods, to the enclosure and LED colors.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have designed an online builder so you can see what your pedal will
      look like when you get it, as well as sound and video examples of how
      these tweaks sound (these demos and audio are coming soon, we promise! For
      now we have a few short clips just to give you a general sense of what the
      mods will do).
    </p>

    <p>
      Our custom shop pedals are made one at a time at our shop in the northern
      part of Los Angeles, exactly like all Wren and Cuff pedals. This website
      was made just to give a nice and separate place to come and virtually
      fiddle with the custom options, take a look at various options, and build
      up your order.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for checking it out!</p>
