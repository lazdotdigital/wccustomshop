    <p>
      <span className="bold">Mid-flat mod:</span> This mod simply takes the
      characteristic deep mid range notch in any muff-style pedal, and flattens
      it out to give a whole other pallet of tones.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span className="bold">Cream mod:</span> Creates a huge output boost, with
      less fuzz but more punch! Called the “creamy dreamer” mod, due to an
      incorrect rumor that this mod was done to Billy Corgans’s pedal when
      recording Siamese Dream. Well, that’s not true, but the mod is!
    </p>

    <p>
      <span className="bold">Clean Blend:</span> An IC buffer and potentiometer
      is added so a clean signal can be used to mix with the fuzz-tone. A bass
      player favorite.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span className="bold">Battery Kill Switch:</span> A toggle that allows
      you to kill the battery power when the pedal is plugged in. Great for
      those purists that love using batteries on their pedal boards, but hate
      having to unplug the input jack when the pedal not being used.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span className="bold">Add Vintage Transistors:</span> Add vintage NOS
      2N5133 transistors. They are noisy and nasty, but if you really gotta have
      vintage, these are the ones for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span className="bold">These mods apply to:</span> Tall Font Russian,
      Small Foot Caprid, White Elk, and Small Foot Box of War (more coming
      soon).
